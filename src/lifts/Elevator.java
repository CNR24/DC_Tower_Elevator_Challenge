 * And the 55-floor elevator is printed. Elevators were randomly distributed at the beginning. You will be prompted to
 * enter your current floor. You will be directed to the nearest elevator. When the elevator arrives, information is
 * given and the destination floor is asked. Then, current floor, destination floor and direction information is given.
 * The elevator reaches the destination floor. And you are asked if you want a new lift.
 * The same action will be repeated if you type true. If you type no, the program terminates.
