# DC-Tower-Elevator-Challenge
## Elevator System with 55 floors and 7 elevators 
```
The task of this project is to design and implement a Java program for the DC Tower elevator system, which manages the demands of a 55-storey building with 7 elevators. 
A request could be both ground floor DC Tower access, i.e. a return journey from floor to ground floor. There is only one key of the elevators. After the system receives
a request, it searches for the next available elevator. If no one is immediately available, the system should schedule the next one to pick up passengers. A request 
consists of current floor, destination floor and travel direction as input
